Write your own MATLAB Routines for the following: 
1. Histogram, Normalized Histogram, Histogram equalization
2. Contrast Stretching 
3. Bit-plane slicing 
4. Power Law Transformation 
5. Intensity Level Slicing (both cases) 
All Inputs should be in the form of Images. Design a graphical user interface which prompts the 
user to select an image file, initially, from any directory from the computer system. Display the 
options in points 1-5 in the form of radio buttons. For every transformation (1-5) appropriate range 
of operations should be provided in the form of text inputs or slide bars, radio buttons etc. All 
outputs should be in the form of images, and additionally, in the form of graphs (e.g. in case of 
histograms, or contrast stretching) demonstrating the initial transformation function or the effect 
of Transformation after application.
